    <h1>Great Quote</h1>
    <h3>He who strikes terror in others is himself continually in fear.</h3>
    <h3>-Claudius Claudianus</h3>
    <p>I agree with this and it hits me because it makes sense. Its human nature to want others to feel the pain 
    you feel. So if you are continually in fear yourself, you will want to strike terror in others so they feel 
    the <em>pain</em> you feel yourself.</p>
